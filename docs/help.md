# Getting Help

We want to know if something is broken, or doesn't make sense. If something isn't right, please [create an issue on github](https://github.com/FactionC2/Faction/issues) so we can take a look at it. We're interested in not only bugs in the code itself, but cases where the documentation needs to be fleshed out or modified.

There's also a FactionC2 channel on the [Bloodhound Slack](https://bloodhoundgang.herokuapp.com/) where developers and others hangout to answer questions.
